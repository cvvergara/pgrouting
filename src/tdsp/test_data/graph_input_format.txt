Graph Input convension:
Line1 contains 3 integers: V E R    -V is no of vertices, E - edges and R - the discrete range of values.
Next V lines have following format:
Start with integer e denoting number of edges going out from that vertex. And next e values in same 
line tell the target vertex of edge.

Next we have E*R lines each conaining 3 integers eid , start_time, travel_time. These are used to generate
weight map.

Last line contains source id.
The distance_map and predecessor_map are printed.
