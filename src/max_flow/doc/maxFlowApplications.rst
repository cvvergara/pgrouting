Applications of Maximum Flow
============================

  - :ref:`pgr_maximumCardinalityMatching` - Calculates a maximum cardinality matching in a graph.
  - :ref:`pgr_edgeDisjointPaths` - Calculates edge disjoint paths between two groups of vertices.

Maximum flow algorithms provide solutions to other graph problems.

Applications
---------------------------------------------

Maximum cardinality matching
...............................

- A matching or independent edge set in a graph is a set of edges without common vertices.
- A maximum matching is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges.
- There may be many maximum matchings.
- The graph can be directed or undirected.

The :ref:`pgr_maximumCardinalityMatching` function can be used to calculate one such maximum matching.

Edge disjoint paths
...............................

In a undirected/directed graph, two paths are edge-disjoint(or edge-independant) if they do not have any internal edge in common.

While the number of maximum edge disjoint paths is fixed, there may be several different routes.

The :ref:`pgr_edgeDisjointPaths` function returns the maximum number of paths and possible routes.
