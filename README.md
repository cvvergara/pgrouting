## INTRODUCTION

pgRouting extends the PostGIS/PostgreSQL geospatial database to provide geospatial routing and other network analysis functionality.

This library contains following features:

* All Pairs Shortest Path, Johnsonâ€™s Algorithm
* All Pairs Shortest Path, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
* Shortest Path A*
* Bi-directional Dijkstra Shortest Path
* Bi-directional A* Shortest Path
* Shortest Path Dijkstra Family of functions
* Shortest Path Dijkstra Cost Family of functions
* Driving Distance
* K-Shortest Path, Multiple Alternative Paths (Yen's algorithm)
* Traveling Sales Person
* Turn Restriction Shortest Path (TRSP)

Additionally, ready for testing and to be part of 2.3 official version:

* Shortest Path Dijkstra With Points Family of functions
* Shortest Path Dijkstra Cost With Points Family of functions
* Driving Distance With Points
* K-Shortest Path With Points, Multiple Alternative Paths (Yen's algorithm)
* Dijkstra Via vertices

Family of functions include:

* one to one
* one to many
* many to one
* many to many
